Note:
Some food variants are missing art.
I've created the resources for them anyway,
either with temporary art or using a different food image.
When the art is available, make sure these are swapped in.

!! Try to update this file when implementing the art !!

Missing foods:
- Croissant: Earl Grey (the almond croissant isn't supposed to exist)
- Scones: All (has since been posted; not in the drive yet)
- Tarts: All
- Cookie: peanut butter, chocolate
