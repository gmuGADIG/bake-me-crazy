Note:
Some food variants are missing art.
I've created the resources for them anyway,
either with temporary art or using a different food image.
When the art is available, make sure these are swapped in.

!! Try to update this file when implementing the art !!

Missing foods:
- Croissant: Earl Grey (uses the almond instead, since almond isn't a real ingredient)
- Scones: All
- Tarts: All
- Cookie: peanut butter, chocolate
