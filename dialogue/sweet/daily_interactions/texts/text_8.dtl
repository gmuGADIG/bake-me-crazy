raymond: Okay, I rewrote this like three times, so I’m just gonna say it\: talking to you has become the best part of my day.[n]Even if it’s just short stuff. Even if it’s just your name popping up.[n]I didn’t expect that. And now I’m just here overthinking and holding my phone like a dork, but... I wanted you to know.[n]In case you ever wondered if you mattered to someone today? You do.
