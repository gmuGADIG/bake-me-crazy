raymond: So, okay—totally random idea. Would you maybe want to go stargazing sometime?[n]I was thinking we could bring snacks and a blanket.[n]Also, I found this little hill just outside town that’s supposed to have an amazing view of the night sky without all the light pollution.[n]It’d be a fun outing![n+] Unless that’s lame.[n+] Is that lame?[n]…This is me awkwardly trying to ask if you’d like to hang out again.  Let me know. No pressure though!!
