raymond: Okay, short story...[n]I was enjoying some ice cream near the coast when suddenly this little kid dropped their own! [n+]And then I just...instinctively handed them mine.
raymond: Which was sweet and all, but I had already done myself a disservice by trying pistachio...then that poor kid had to finish the rest of it.[n+] Plus it super-sucked to sacrifice my ice cream.[n]Anyway, I just found myself wishing I could talk to you about it! You wouldâ€™ve made a comment that made it all seem so funny. [n+]Is that weird?
