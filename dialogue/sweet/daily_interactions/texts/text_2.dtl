raymond: I passed by a bakery today—not your bakery, but some chain place that had a sign outside saying “Freshest pastries in town!”[n]I swear I stood there staring at the window like a snob. I was like “Mm… I know someone who could bake literal circles around you.”[n]Anyway, I didn’t go in. It felt like betrayal.[n+] Also now I’m craving something with cinnamon.
raymond: Do you guys ever make cinnamon stars? That feels like a thing. (If not, consider this my formal request?)
