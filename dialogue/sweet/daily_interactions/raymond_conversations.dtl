The customer stares at the glass casing of pastries for a concerning amount of time.

- “Something catch your fancy?”

raymond: Hm? Oh! Yeah, sorry.[n]Uhh, could I have…uh, one of those things?
He points to what you know to be choux pastries.

- ”A choux pastry?”

raymond: Oh, that’s how you pronounce it. Thanks! Man, it’s choux huge, it could have its own orbit! Eh? It’s a two-in-one baking and astronomy joke.[n]Anyways, I’ll remember that for when I come back tomorrow!

raymond: Oh, hi! It’s you again![n]You have to give me what I had last time, it was ”out of this world!” Heh, heh. Ehh…[n]Sorry.

raymond: Random astronomy fact of the day\: neutron stars are so dense that a single teaspoon of their material would weigh about 6 billion tons, which is roughly the same as a mountain on Earth![n]Lemme know if you ever get sick of hearing this stuff.

raymond: Oh, hey... No, I'm fine.[n]I finished a writeup for an exhibit at the planetarium and tried showing it to my parents. It wasn’t anything bad, just, I expected more of a reaction from them.[n]But it’s nothing a choux pastry can’t fix!

raymond: Ugh, you know what’s been bothering me?[n+]All those conspiracy nuts who say the moon landing was fake.

- “Hold on. It was fake?!”
	raymond: Wha–NO! No, it most certainly wasn’t fake!
- “Of course it was real!”
	raymond: Exactly! I don’t know how they could be so wrong!

raymond: I mean, it’s one of mankind’s greatest accomplishments towards the future of space travel, and people go and say it’s fake! The nerve!

raymond: Sigh... I’ve dealt with too many people mistaking astronomy with astrology. I don’t wanna sound rude, but I don’t know how they make that mistake![n]I mean, one is proven by science, and the other…well…[n+] Oh, never mind, it’s really not that big of a deal.

raymond: I recently got recommended this new show called The Big Splat Theory.[n]I was super excited at first! I was expecting this epic and in-depth analysis about the creation of the moon, but it turns out it’s just some silly sitcom.

- “Aw, that’s lame.”
	raymond: Right? I suppose I’ll just have to rewatch all 5 seasons of Exo-Defenders again. [n]Although I suppose that show isn’t very informative either…
- “I love that show!”
	raymond: Really? Hm, well, I suppose I can give the show a fairer shot next time.

raymond: I’ve been learning a lot about distant galaxies, and while they are incredibly fascinating, I feel like we as humans do them a disservice in how we classify them.

- “What makes you say that?”
	raymond: Some of these names are absolutely ridiculous!
- “I think the Milky Way is a clever name.”
	raymond: Oh, trust me. It only goes downhill from there!
raymond: Get this, we named one the “Hockey Stick Galaxy” just because it’s shaped like one! Surely, we could’ve thought of something more creative than that![n]Maybe a title such as “Knife Edge Galaxy” would’ve sufficed…[n]Wait…that one’s already taken?! Maybe we are running out of good options after all.

raymond: Here’s another random astronomy fact of the day! Saturn is less dense than water, so if you had a big enough bathtub, it would float!

label 10
raymond: YAAAWNNN… Oh, heeey. I’m just a little tired from pulling an all-nighter on my speech presentation for the planetarium. Remember that paper on stellar formation that you ran into a while back? Now I'll be doing a speech.

- “Do you need a coffee for the day?”
	raymond: Yes, please. Cream and sugar too, if that’s possible.
- “Wow, seems like you have a lot on your plate!”
	raymond: Huh? No I don’t, I haven’t even ordered yet![n]Oh, you meant metaphorically… Maybe I should take a nap later today.

raymond: I recently watched this movie called “Intergalactic” which had this famous actor named Matthrough McCournalghey.[n]He essentially travels space to save the earth from dying, which I thought was silly considering humanity wouldn’t be doomed for another few centuries.[n]It had some very interesting themes pertaining to real life space theories like wormholes, but I think this movie would be more enjoyable as an anime.

raymond: Here’s another random astronomy fact of the day![n]Neutron stars rotate and send out radiation pulses 700 times per second, similar to a supercharged lighthouse that gives out pulses instead of light!

raymond: Man, summer is literally right around the corner, and I still can’t believe how much has happened throughout these past few weeks with the astronomy club and at home.[n]I couldn’t have done it without you, so thanks, for everything!

label 14
raymond: Hey! I just got back from my astronomy club’s final meeting! I gotta say, I’m gonna miss quite a few of those members…they really knew how to keep the place engaging.[n]The earth really is a small place in the grand scheme of things, so no matter how far they go, I’m sure I’ll bump into them somehow![n]Hey, with those empty spots, you can join the club if you’d like.

- “Do you really think they would allow me in?”
	raymond: Well…I’m sure I could, uh, make some…arrangements.
- “Even if I don’t know that much about astronomy?”
	raymond: Absolutely! In fact, there are plenty of members like you who are new to the subject! It just means more passionate people, which is always good for the club.
raymond: Only if you really want to, though! I dunno, I just think you might find it interesting, is all. Tell me what you think sometime! I always love seeing new members!
