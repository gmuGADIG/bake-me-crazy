(neutral)Oh, hello. Uhh, what do I want? Uhh, c-could I have that? (points to food item as he doesn’t know what it’s called). Thanks. (happy) wow, it’s so much bigger than it looked, it could have its own orbit! Heh, sorry, astronomy pun. Have a good day!\

Raymond is staring at the glass casing.
raymond: Oh, hey! Um, just trying to figure out what I want. That thing, maybe? Whatever it's called...

raymond (Happy): Random astronomy fact of the day! Neutron stars are so dense that a single teaspoon of their material would weigh about 6 billion tons, which is roughly the same as a mountain on Earth!

raymond: Oh, hey. No, I'm fine. I finished a writeup for an exhibit at the planetarium and tried showing it to my parents.[n]It wasn’t anything bad, just, I expected more of a reaction from them.[n]But it’s nothing a pastry won't fix...
label 5
raymond: You know what’s been bothering me? All those conspiracy nuts who say the moon landing was fake.[n]I mean, one the greatest accomplishments of mankind towards the future of space travel and people go and say it’s fake! The nerve!
label 6
raymond: Sigh...[n+]I’ve dealt with too many people mistaking Astronomy with Astrology. I don’t wanna sound rude, but I don’t know how they make that mistake![n]I mean, one is proven by science, and the other…well…[n+] Oh, never mind, it’s really not that big of a deal.

raymond: I recently got recommended this new show called The Big Splat Theory. I was expecting this in-depth analysis about the creation of the moon...[n+]turns out it’s just some silly sitcom.[n]I suppose I’ll just have to rewatch all 5 seasons of Exo-Defenders again.[n+]Huh... I suppose that show isn’t very informative either…

raymond: I’ve been learning a lot about distant galaxies, and while they are incredibly fascinating, I feel like we as humans do them a disservice in how we classify them.[n]Get this, we named one the “Hockey Stick Galaxy” just because it’s shaped like one! Surely, we could’ve thought of something more creative than that![n]Maybe a title such as “Knife Edge Galaxy” would suffice![n+] Wait…that one’s already taken. Maybe we are running out of options after all.

raymond: Yawn...ohh, hey. I’m just a little tired from pulling an all-nighter on my speech for the planetarium. Remember that paper on stellar formation that you ran into a while back? Now I'm presenting it![n]Wish me luck! And if you could acquire me a coffee, cream with sugar.
label 10
raymond: Here’s another random astronomy fact of the day! Saturn is less dense than water, so if you had a big enough bathtub, it would float![n]As you can imagine, that makes Saturn-themed bath bombs pretty fun. Not that I regularly use bath bombs or anything...\

raymond: I recently watched this movie called “Intergalactic” which had this famous actor named Matthew McCournalghey. He Essentially travels space to save the earth from dying, which I thought was silly considering humanity won’t be doomed for another few centuries.\
\
It had some very interesting themes pertaining to real life space theories like wormholes, but I think this movie would be more enjoyable as an anime.\
