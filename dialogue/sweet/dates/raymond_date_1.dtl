raymond (Excited): Hey! Glad that you could make it!
raymond (Happy): I made sure to clear out all of my projects for school for today. I even picked up an earlier shift at the planetarium too! Although, that was a quick way to learn that I’m not much of a morning person…[n]Let’s start making our way inside! There’s this one place we have to see first.
You both enter the carnival. You both passed many of the typical All-American concoctions that you remember seeing when you were younger. Just as you and Ray neared the end of the aisle, Ray stopped by a stand that seemed to only sell one thing\: Funnel Cakes.
raymond: YES! They’re still selling here! This right here is one of the best carnival food stands on the planet, you HAVE to try it out!
