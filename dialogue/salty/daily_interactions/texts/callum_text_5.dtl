callum: I tried to start a new hobby today. Turns out, sulking isn’t officially a hobby.
callum: I checked.
- What were you trying to do?
callum: Writing. But I stared at a blank page for an hour and ended up just doodling a really sad cactus.
- You’re not that bad, you know.
callum: Flattery. Dangerous move. Keep that up and I might start liking myself again.
- That hobby has potential. Want company?
callum:  Oh, I always want company. Especially the kind that brings snacks.
