	callum: Okay, now I’m blushing. Dangerous thing to say to a guy who’s used to giving himself pep talks in grocery aisles.
- You’re the main character. That’s gotta count for something.
	callum: Main character? Please. I’m the love interest who shows up halfway through and complicates things in a sexy, annoying way.
