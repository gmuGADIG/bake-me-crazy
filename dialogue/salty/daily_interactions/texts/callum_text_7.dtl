callum: I tried baking today. Burned a tray of cookies and possibly summoned a demon from the smoke in the oven.[n] His name is Steve. He’s actually really chill.
- Pics or it didn’t happen.
	callum: Steve’s camera-shy, but the cookies look like fossils. I’ll send those.
- Need a baking assistant next time?
	callum: Only if you’re okay with chaos and sarcastic commentary. I’m not responsible if we summon Steve again.
- Maybe leave the oven alone next time.
	callum: Noted. Next time I’ll just eat raw dough and call it a day.
