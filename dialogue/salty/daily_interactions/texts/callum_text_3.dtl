callum: You ever get the feeling that this town is just… a really elaborate prank?[n]I feel like someone, somewhere is laughing every time I walk past the same three buildings and have to pretend it’s not soul-crushing.

- It’s not that bad.
	callum: If denial were a sport, I’d have a trophy by now. I mean, look at me still pretending I’m “temporarily” here.
- So... you’re adjusting well, huh?
	callum: Yeah, I’m thriving. Next week I plan to cry into a loaf of bread at the bakery. Gotta spice up the routine.

- Wanna escape for a bit? Coffee?
	callum: You had me at “escape.” Coffee sounds like the kind of reckless decision i’d make. Let me know when.
