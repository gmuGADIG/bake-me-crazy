callum: Fun fact: I used to live ten minutes from the beach. Now I live ten minutes from a gas station that smells like despair.

- You really miss California, huh?
	callum: Every single day. I swear the sun there had vibes. The sun here feels like it’s judging me.


- At least the gas station sells snacks.
	callum: Okay, fair. Their gummy worms do slap. But it’s not quite sand-between-your-toes level joy.

- Trade you towns?
	callum: You don’t want that smoke. I’ll take your town, but you’re stuck with my self-esteem issues. No refunds.
