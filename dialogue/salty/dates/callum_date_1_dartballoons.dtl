Callum seems nervous...
callum (neutral): Oh my gosh, I forgot about this. I was never able to play this game because I got too scared whenever the balloons popped.
- "We can go somewhere else if you want."
	callum (confused): What? No, I’m fine. I can do this.
	update callum (pensive)
	Callum glances away, embarrassed.
- "How old were you when you last went to a carnival?"
	callum (disgusted): That would be two years ago. Look, loud noises startle me. But, you know, new town, new me.
	Callum looks annoyed at you...
	set {dateRP} -= 15
- "I get that. Balloons are scary."
	callum (disgusted): I am not scared of balloons! I just don'’t like the loud noises they make when they pop.
	set {dateRP} += 10
Callum walks up to attempt the game. [n+] He hits... [n+] nothing.
callum (confused): Are all of these games rigged? Oh, whatever, I should be relieved none of them popped... [n+] Go ahead, your turn. I bet you can do better.

	# breaks choice tree
	- Throw!

		callum (shocked): Sorry! That was...louder than expected.
		The stall manager hands you a small reward! Nice.
- Unleash you special move!
	You throw all darts at once. You win zero points for flashiness, and zero for hitting balloons... [n+] You hear Callum sigh with relief.
- Imagine the darts are forks, and the balloons are pies...
	You lean forward and try to scoop the balloons with the darts. [n+] The stall manager asks you to leave...

	callum (confused): Were you nervous to throw, or something? Ah, whatever.
callum (disgusted): This place was a bust. Come on, let's figure out something else to do.
