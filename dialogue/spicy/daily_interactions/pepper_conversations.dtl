pepper: Hey...[n+] I thought I recognized that face![n] You’re {player_name}, right?[n+] It’s Pepper, remember?[n] We used to be friends when we were kids.
- Of course, how could I forget?
pepper: Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about![n] It’s great to see you. I just got hit with a blast from the past!
- No, sorry. Could you remind me?
pepper: That’s fair, I guess.[n+] We were pretty little.[n] I lived down the street from you and we used to hang out after school.
pepper: That’s great though, I didn’t know you were back in town![n] I’ve never been here before, do you work here?
- Yep! I’m still pretty new, though.
pepper: Well, that’s still awesome![n+] Personally, I’m running my parents’ sports store nowadays.[n] We should try to meet up sometime![n+] Like, catch up or hang out again.

pepper: I saw a customer cry after one bite of your danish.[n]Not like, sad tears. Existential joy tears.[n+]It was kind of terrifying, honestly.

label 3
pepper: Okay, be honest\: how many of those pastries do you "test" before putting them out?[n+]Like percentage-wise. I won't judge.[n]Unless it's more than 30%, then I might.
- Only the ones that look too sad to sell.
pepper: You're like a pastry therapist. I respect that.
- I don't eat the inventory!
pepper: Liar. Coward. I would if I worked here.

pepper: Do you think if I trained hard enough, I could throw a loaf of sourdough like a discus?[n]Not that I would.[n+]Probably.

label 5
pepper: I tried baking once. Made scones.[n+]They could legally qualify as blunt weapons.[n]My neighbor used one as a doorstop for a week.
- I’m honored by the attempt.
pepper: Yeah, it was kind of a tribute. Like fanart, but tragic.
- Maybe I can teach you sometime.
pepper: Bold of you to assume I’m teachable, but sounds good!

label 6
pepper: If you ever hear yelling from outside it’s just me racing my own shadow again.[n]It’s fine, we’re evenly matched.

label 7
pepper: You ever name your dough?[n]Not like... out loud. But in your head? Like, "Ah yes, this one’s Gary. He’s gonna be a croissant."
- I absolutely do that.
pepper: I knew it. I knew you were the dough whisperer.
- That is deranged.
pepper: You say that now, but one day you’ll make a muffin that looks like a Harold.

label 8
pepper: Okay, serious emergency. I forgot what I came in here for.[n]I walked in with purpose. I had a goal.[n+]Now I’m just standing next to these muffins and panicking.

label 9
pepper: You ever feel like you’ve got too many feelings and nowhere to put ’em?[n]Like you try to say something nice and it comes out as a wrestling threat.
- I feel that all the time.
pepper: Good. We can be aggressively kind together.
- You threaten people a lot, huh?
pepper: Only the ones I like.

label 10
pepper: I tried recreating your cinnamon rolls at home.[n]They came out...[n+]confused.[n]Like they weren’t sure if they were bread or abstract art.
[end_timeline]

label 11
pepper: Hey. I was thinking about that story you told the other day.[n+]The one about the burnt pie?[n]I keep coming back to it. Not sure why.
- It’s a dumb story.
pepper: Nah. Dumb things stick with us for a reason.
- Glad you remembered it.
pepper: Couldn’t forget if I tried.

label 12
pepper: You know how some people talk to their plants, or their fish?[n]I do that with my running shoes.[n+]“C’mon, guys! You can make it one more mile!”
[end_timeline]

label 13
pepper: Do you ever get tired of people asking you if you’re okay when you’re just thinking?[n]Like, no, I’m not having a breakdown.[n]I’m just thinking about pastries with faces in a soap opera.[n+]Flour opera?
- Maybe you just look dramatic while you zone out.
pepper: I have been known to look like I’m plotting while thinking about stuff...
- What kind of drama would pastries have?
pepper: Well you see, this croissant saw their sweet tart getting too sweet with the sourdough.[n]Now they’re reconsidering the engagement, and the family’s getting involved.
