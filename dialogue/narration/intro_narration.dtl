Today marks two weeks before Leaventide’s annual [b]culture festival[/b].
When the event was announced, you set a milestone for yourself: you would celebrate the culture festival with a [wave]special someone[/wave].
Up until now, your efforts have been lackluster. Your job at Ivy’s Southern Sweets, the town’s crown jewel of a bakery, has absorbed all of your time.
But food is the best way to someone's heart! Two weeks and the right baked treats will surely be enough to make a rather romantic impression on someone.
Once you learn which [b]ingredients[/b] they like, you can buy them at the market and put them to use during the [b]morning shift[/b].
The [b]lunch break[/b] is your chance to socialize and share the delicious gifts you've baked.
Then it's over to the [b]lunch rush[/b], where you'll earn cash for tomorrow's ingredients.
Time to get busy!
