millie: Hello, dear! I had a delightful time at the carnival last the other day. I usually dislike those types of events, as I find them too loud.[n]Being there with you, however, made it a lot more bearable and fun. Maybe it’s not that I like the carnival, but that I like your company![n]I find myself finding so many more things fun when you’re around. Is that weird? I hope not! Let's hang out again soon, friend.
