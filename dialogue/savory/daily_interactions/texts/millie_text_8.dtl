Hello, dear. I have to say, I’ve gotten used to talking to you so frequently.[n]I usually chat very little, so it’s very surprising for me. I think I made a good decision to make time for our conversations at Ivy's![n]What I mean to say is that I’m happy that I got to meet you, and I enjoy chatting with you. I’m looking forward to getting to know you more in the time to come!
