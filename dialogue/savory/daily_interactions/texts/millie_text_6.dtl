millie: I don't mean to be a killjoy, but I had an awful day this week.[n]I feel so irrational about for this, but I saw a stranger who looked a lot like someone from my past, and it made me boil inside.[n]Later that same day, I witnessed another incident of littering in the park! It feels like no one cares about the environment anymore these days.[n]The earth gives so much to us, and we take it for granted. You'll be sure to see me at the bakery today for a pick-me-up pastry.
