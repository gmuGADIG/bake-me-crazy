millie: Hello, dear, I hope you're well! I went with the cleanup crew to pick up trash around the town together.[n]I didn’t expect it to be so tiring, however! I don’t know if you know this, but I usually have to lift a lot of weight for my job.[n]So imagine my surprise at how exhausting it was to walk around all day picking up trash! It gives me a newfound appreciation for trash cleaners.[n]Remember to dispose of waste properly to protect the environment, as well as our sore backs!
