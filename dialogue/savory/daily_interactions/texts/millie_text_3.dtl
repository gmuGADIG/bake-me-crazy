millie: Dear, please tell me you understand the importance of farms.[n]When I was in town, a stranger asked me if farming was my hobby. I don’t know why, but her question got on my nerves![n]I suppose that even a small town like Leaventide doesn’t understand the importance of local agriculture. Perhaps you could blame it on the media?[n]Anyhow, it's rather tedious to work as the sole farmhand and a butcher at the same time, so it would be nice if people acknowledged it as the challenging job that it really is!
