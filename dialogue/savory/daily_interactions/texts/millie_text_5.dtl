millie: I have a strange customer that comes around often...[n+]Every week, they come in and ask for ten pounds of beef.[n]They’re rather buff, and they always talk about the precise amount of protein in my product...I’m not too sure why they’re so obsessed with it.[n]I also wonder why they order so much! I really hope they aren’t wasting it. If they are, they won’t be welcome in my store any longer.

millie: The stall manager of Natty Flavorz? No, it wasn't.[n]Oh, but I suppose this means she has some competition around town! How fun.
