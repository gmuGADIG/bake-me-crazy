millie: Hello again, dear. I thought you might be happy to hear that my cow named Goldierod recently gave birth to a heifer. Just a fun fact about what’s gone on at the farm! What should I name her?
- “Why not name it after me?"
	millie: Sorry, dear, but that feels inappropriate. Even {player_name} Jr. feels off. Thank you for the suggestion regardless.
- “How about Goldiebod?”
	millie: Hah hah! That sounds ridiculous. I don’t mean to downplay the suggestion, but all I can think of with that name is a cow with a body of pure gold—and you can’t butcher gold!
- “Butterscotch!”
	millie: Ohh, how sweet. I adore that one! Butterscotch it is.
